# Pilsner Urquell Game: A Fun and Sexy Arcade Game
 
Pilsner Urquell Game is a free online game that was created by the Czech beer company Pilsner Urquell as a promotional tie-in. The game is also known as Undress Me!!! or Hung Bia in some regions. The game is simple but addictive: you have to catch as many falling bottles of Pilsner Urquell beer as possible with a crate, while avoiding other objects that can break your bottles. The more bottles you catch, the more points you get, and the more clothes your chosen girl will take off. There are three girls to choose from, each with different difficulty levels and outfits. The game ends when you miss three bottles or when the girl is fully undressed.

If you are looking for some cheats or tips to beat the game, here are some suggestions:
 
- Choose the girl that suits your skill level. The blonde girl is the easiest, the brunette is medium, and the redhead is hard. The harder the girl, the faster the bottles will fall and the more objects will appear.
- Focus on the bottles and ignore the distractions. The game will try to trick you with fake bottles, bombs, birds, and other objects that can break your bottles or make you lose focus. Don't let them fool you and keep your eyes on the real bottles.
- Use your mouse to move the crate left and right. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard, but the mouse is more precise and responsive.
- Don't be greedy. Sometimes it's better to let a bottle go than to risk breaking your crate or missing another bottle.
- Enjoy the show. The game is meant to be fun and sexy, so don't take it too seriously. You can always replay the game if you want to see more of the girls or try a different difficulty level.

Pilsner Urquell Game is not only a fun and sexy arcade game, but also a tribute to the history and culture of Pilsner Urquell, the world's first golden pilsner beer. Pilsner Urquell was first brewed in 1842 in the city of PlzeÅ, Czech Republic, by a Bavarian brewmaster named Josef Groll. He used local ingredients and a new bottom-fermenting yeast to create a beer that was clear, golden, and refreshing, unlike the dark and cloudy beers of that time. The beer was an instant success and soon became popular around the world, inspiring many other brewers to imitate its style and name[^3^].
 
Today, Pilsner Urquell is still brewed in PlzeÅ, using the same recipe and traditional methods as in 1842. The beer is made with soft water from PlzeÅ's own wells, Saaz hops from nearby fields, malted barley from Moravia, and a special yeast strain that has been preserved for over 180 years. The beer is fermented and lagered in wooden barrels in the brewery's historic cellars, giving it a distinctive flavor and aroma. Pilsner Urquell is best enjoyed fresh and cold, with a thick layer of wet foam that protects the beer from oxidation and enhances its taste[^3^].
 
If you want to learn more about Pilsner Urquell and its history, you can visit the brewery in PlzeÅ and take a guided tour that includes tasting the unfiltered and unpasteurized beer straight from the barrel. You can also visit the new Pilsner Urquell Experience in Prague, a state-of-the-art interactive attraction that tells the story of the world's first golden pilsner through audio-visual effects, games, and exhibits[^1^] [^2^]. Whether you are a beer lover or just curious, you will find something to enjoy and discover at Pilsner Urquell Experience.
